I suspect it was impressed by your rather exceptional agility in sorting all those ghastly improperly organized letters.\r\n\r\nThough it pains me greatly to do so, I am left with little choice. You shall find your new companion enclosed within this letter. Worry not, mailementals actually find the confines of a well-creased envelope quite comfortable.
