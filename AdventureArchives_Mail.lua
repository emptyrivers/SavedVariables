I suspect it was impressed by your rather exceptional agility in sorting all those ghastly improperly organized letters.\r\n\r\nThough it pains me greatly to do so, I am left with little choice. You shall find your new companion enclosed within this letter. Worry not, mailementals actually find the confines of a well-creased envelope quite comfortable. You may use it as a crate of sort, if you so desire.\r\n\r\n-The Postmaster",

I must ask you to help me orchestrate once more to guide more into these stamped halls to give me aid.\r\n\r\nTake the attached message and send it to someone you deem worthy to carry the torch forward.
