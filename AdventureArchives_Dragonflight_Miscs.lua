			"This heavy book contains recipes and uses for various types of explosives, from conventional to exotic. You quickly flip through to the section entitled \"Anti-Magical Ordnance.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you've ever gotta take down some kind of magic barrier, then you might have to get a bit unconventional with your munitions. You could stack an ogre-sized heap of dynamite against one and you're only likely to end up with some scorched ground, and maybe a missing limb or two.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately, Megacharge has got you covered there, with the Arcane Bunker Buster (patent pending)!\"", -- [1]
			"\"To make one, you'll first need to acquire some high grade, precision blasting powder. Here in Blackfuse Company, it's pretty easy to come by, since they use it for all of the cannons. \r\n\r\n\"If you're elsewhere in the world, though, you'll need to find a top-of-the-line producer, as only the finest blasting powder will work in this application.\"", -- [2]
			"\"For a detonator, you'll need one of those high-charge electric deals. The Arcane Bunker Buster requires a lot of juice to go off, so your average detonator just won't do.\"\r\n\r\nA note is attached to this page:\r\n\r\n\"Reminder: Order more high-voltage detonators. The last shipment was lost off of the Shadowmoon coast near the demon-inhabited cliffs. Maybe we should send a diving team to salvage.\"", -- [3]
			"\"The final, and most important ingredient for the Arcane Bunker Buster, is a sizable quantity of demon blood. The unique properties of the magic-infused blood combine with the blasting powder into an incredibly potent mixture. \r\n\r\n\"When ignited by a high-voltage electric charge, this combination will explode in a magically-charged explosion, sufficient enough to take down most arcane barriers.\r\n\r\n\"Just make sure to take cover before the thing goes off.\"", -- [4]

			"The brave titan Aggramar discovered Azeroth, shining like a beacon in the Great Dark.\r\n\r\nAs he gazed upon the beauty and power of its slumbering soul, he realized it was imperiled. He told the other members of the Pantheon how the world they sought had been corrupted by the Old Gods.\r\n\r\nThe titans gathered to eradicate this dark influence.", -- [3]
			"Seeking to bring hope and healing, our patron titan, Eonar, carried a gift given to her by Elune--a branch of G'Hanir, the mother world tree.\r\n\r\nThe titan believed that the influence of Life would drive the darkness away.\r\n\r\nSo she reached down her hand and shaped the soil of Azeroth, planting the branch where it could be fed by river and sky.", -- [4]
			"The branch swiftly grew into a tree, its roots extending deep, deep below the surface. Eonar smiled, for everywhere the roots stretched, new life emerged.\r\n\r\nShe called the tree Elun'Ahir, in honor of her great love.\r\n\r\nWhen Aman'Thul saw what Eonar had done, he chided her. \"This is not Order!\" he bellowed. \"You have infected this world with uncontrolled chaos!\"\r\n\r\nThe Highfather took hold of the world tree's trunk and tore it from the earth.", -- [5]
			"Eonar wept bitter tears that rained down upon the resulting crater.\r\n\r\nBut as she peered down upon the sundered earth, the titan realized a truth she did not share with the Highfather.\r\n\r\nThough he had destroyed the tree, its winding roots still held firm beneath the soil, hidden from Aman'Thul's gaze.", -- [6]
			"As the forces of the titans waged war against the Black Empire, Eonar bid her keeper, Freya, to watch over the crater and nurture the life that blossomed there.\r\n\r\nBelow ground, the roots fed upon the tears of Eonar and grew strong.\r\n\r\nThe war was long, but in the end, the titans claimed victory. And Eonar was pleased, knowing Elune's legacy would endure.", -- [7]
			"It is said that much later, as the world entered a new age, mysterious guardians arrived who dedicated their lives to protecting the roots.\r\n\r\nBut that is a tale for another time.\r\n\r\nNow let us stand with our allies to defend Amirdrassil, crown of harmony. Together, we will preserve this symbol of hope. This symbol of the future.", -- [8]
