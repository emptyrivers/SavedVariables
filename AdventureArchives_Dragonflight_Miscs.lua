"This heavy book contains recipes and uses for various types of explosives, from conventional to exotic. You quickly flip through to the section entitled \"Anti-Magical Ordnance.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you've ever gotta take down some kind of magic barrier, then you might have to get a bit unconventional with your munitions. You could stack an ogre-sized heap of dynamite against one and you're only likely to end up with some scorched ground, and maybe a missing limb or two.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately, Megacharge has got you covered there, with the Arcane Bunker Buster (patent pending)!\"",
"\"To make one, you'll first need to acquire some high grade, precision blasting powder. Here in Blackfuse Company, it's pretty easy to come by, since they use it for all of the cannons. \r\n\r\n\"If you're elsewhere in the world, though, you'll need to find a top-of-the-line producer, as only the finest blasting powder will work in this application.\"",
"\"For a detonator, you'll need one of those high-charge electric deals. The Arcane Bunker Buster requires a lot of juice to go off, so your average detonator just won't do.\"\r\n\r\nA note is attached to this page:\r\n\r\n\"Reminder: Order more high-voltage detonators. The last shipment was lost off of the Shadowmoon coast near the demon-inhabited cliffs. Maybe we should send a diving team to salvage.\"",
"\"The final, and most important ingredient for the Arcane Bunker Buster, is a sizable quantity of demon blood. The unique properties of the magic-infused blood combine with the blasting powder into an incredibly potent mixture. \r\n\r\n\"When ignited by a high-voltage electric charge, this combination will explode in a magically-charged explosion, sufficient enough to take down most arcane barriers.\r\n\r\n\"Just make sure to take cover before the thing goes off.\"",

The greatest honor a tribute can have is the act of sacrifice!\r\n\r\nNaturally, we flayed the interloper's skin and presented it as additional tribute, but its foolish gesture made me pause and think.\r\n\r\nAre tributes capable of higher thought? Do they possess their own desires?\r\n\r\nI know they are capable of language, and their cleverness makes them more effective at work than other animals, but should we regard them as more than brutish beasts?",
"Any type of animal can communicate with its own kind, I suppose. Some just happen to meld their tongues to approximate our language. Such a clever trick! They do not speak it well, and they cannot grasp higher concepts... but what if they could? \r\n\r\nPerhaps I will try to train one, as an experiment. After all, the pursuit of knowledge is its own reward.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, it will make for a unique tribute. Would it be selfish to keep its skin? Yes, perhaps that would be too much.

Their hit-and-run tactics on the Lich King's strongholds stymied his efforts to root them out time after time. Ultimately Ner'zhul's war against the nerubians was won by attrition. With the aid of the sinister dreadlords and innumerable undead warriors, the Lich King invaded Azjol-Nerub and brought its subterranean temples crashing down upon the spider lords' heads.",
