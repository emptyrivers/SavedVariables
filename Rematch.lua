I tried all of the strats on offer here, but none of them worked well for me, so i made my own. I used the basis of one of the other strats, and tried to improve on it. The TD script is set to auto forfeit the match if you dont kill the Owl in 3 turns. It usually does, but not always, and i noticed that when it didn't, the failure rate on the match was 90+ percent. With this method, i've donr around 20 matches, only 2 failed to kill the Owl and auto forfeited, all the others won (though that is a small sample size and i might just have gotten lucky).\n\nAlso, Arcane Storm that the Owl uses is strong against Flying pets, so you'll probably need a level 5 or so leveling pet to survive it.\n\nTurn 1: Clean-Up\nTurn 2: Soulrush\nTurn 3: Magic Sword (this should kill the Owl, if not restart (script autoexits if the Owl is still alive)\nTurn 4: Magic Sword against Rat until Servant of Demidos dies\nBring in Darkmoon Zeppelin\nTurn 5: Decoy\nTurn 6: Missile until Rat has below threshold health for Nuke\nTurn 7: Explode\n",

They can be level 1, neither of them take damage.  This gives you plenty of flexibility when it comes to what pets you want to level, and are less likely to waste potential xp on pets that are already in their 20s.\n\nShadowlands Update:  I've updated the strategy.  Something changed with prepatch and Slow Moe dies quicker than he used to.  I've added a Pass in order to better line up Prowl and Feed with Snot's Dive.  However, if Xu-Fu crits Slow Moe with Feed, you may be in some trouble now, as Feed may not be available again for Snot.  I've updated the TD script, but I think you may need a bandage around 25% of the time now [the chance Headbutt stuns you], and there's even a slim chance for Xu-Fu to die.  \n\n[That can happen IF you crit Slow Moe with Feed, one shotting him, and then Snot rolls high with Dive and it deals a critical hit.  Then you don't crit with Bite, and die one turn before Feed is available again.]\n\nTurn 1: Pass\nTurn 2: Swap to your Xu-Fu, Cub of Xuen\nTurn 3: Prowl\nTurn 4: Pass\nTurn 5: Feed\nTurn 6: Bite, Rocklick dies\nSlow Moe comes in\nTurn 1: Swap to your second Level Pet (third slot)\nTurn 2: Swap back to your Xu-Fu, Cub of Xuen\nTurn 4: Prowl - If you are stunned, or if Prowl is still on cooldown for 1 round, Pass for a turn then continue with Prowl.\nTurn 5: Pass\nTurn 6: Feed\nTurn 6: Bite when Slow Moe's Shell Shield has a 5 round duration.

Looks dangerous but my answer is... Blistering Cold :-)\n\nTo get as much Frostbite applications as possible on Mindshackle I use Blistering Cold two times before I force my Boneshard to die. To make it even worse for the opponent I also add a Bleeding effect. Black Claw and Shattered Defenses applied by Hunting Party, Flock or Swarm will then buff Frostbite/Bleeding damage.\n\nYou can replace Zandalari Raptors with Foulfeather, Ikky or Chitterspine Skitterling (8.2 Nazjatar wild catch), the script can handle them all and will also bring your third pet to pass the last turn if your birdies die.\n\nTurn 1: Blistering Cold\nTurn 2: Chop\nTurn 3: BONESTORM\nTurn 4: Blistering Cold (Boneshard dies)\nBring in your Black Claw + Swarm ability pet\nTurn 1: Black Claw\nTurn 2+: Hunting Party, Flock or Swarm\n\nWhen your Mech comes in (while using vulnerable Flying pets with Black Claw)\nPass turn\n",

They can be level 1, neither of them take damage.  This gives you plenty of flexibility when it comes to what pets you want to level, and are less likely to waste potential xp on pets that are already in their 20s.\n\nShadowlands Update:  I've updated the strategy.  Something changed with prepatch and Slow Moe dies quicker than he used to.  I've added a Pass in order to better line up Prowl and Feed with Snot's Dive.  However, if Xu-Fu crits Slow Moe with Feed, you may be in some trouble now, as Feed may not be available again for Snot.  I've updated the TD script, but I think you may need a bandage around 25% of the time now [the chance Headbutt stuns you], and there's even a slim chance for Xu-Fu to die.  \n\n[That can happen IF you crit Slow Moe with Feed, one shotting him, and then Snot rolls high with Dive and it deals a critical hit.  Then you don't crit with Bite, and die one turn before Feed is available again.]\n\nTurn 1: Pass\nTurn 2: Swap to your Xu-Fu, Cub of Xuen\nTurn 3: Prowl\nTurn 4: Pass\nTurn 5: Feed\nTurn 6: Bite, Rocklick dies\nSlow Moe comes in\nTurn 1: Swap to your second Level Pet (third slot)\nTurn 2: Swap back to your Xu-Fu, Cub of Xuen\nTurn 4: Prowl - If you are stunned, or if Prowl is still on cooldown for 1 round, Pass for a turn then continue with Prowl.\nTurn 5: Pass\nTurn 6: Feed\nTurn 6: Bite when Slow Moe's Shell Shield has a 5 round duration.  Pass if it has a 1 round duration, then Bite him next turn.\nSnot comes in\nTurn 1: Bite\nIs Prowl available?\nIF: YES\nTurn 2: Prowl\nTurn 3: Feed - Snot dies\nIF: NO\nTurn 2: Bite\nTurn 3: Pass\nTurn 4: Feed\nTurn 5: Bite until Snot dies\n",

I tried all of the strats on offer here, but none of them worked well for me, so i made my own. I used the basis of one of the other strats, and tried to improve on it. The TD script is set to auto forfeit the match if you dont kill the Owl in 3 turns. It usually does, but not always, and i noticed that when it didn't, the failure rate on the match was 90+ percent. With this method, i've donr around 20 matches, only 2 failed to kill the Owl and auto forfeited, all the others won (though that is a small sample size and i might just have gotten lucky).\n\nAlso, Arcane Storm that the Owl uses is strong against Flying pets, so you'll probably need a level 5 or so leveling pet to survive it.\n\nTurn 1: Clean-Up\nTurn 2: Soulrush\nTurn 3: Magic Sword (this should kill the Owl, if not restart (script autoexits if the Owl is still alive)\nTurn 4: Magic Sword against Rat until Servant of Demidos dies\nBring in Darkmoon Zeppelin\nTurn 5: Decoy\nTurn 6: Missile until Rat has below threshold health for Nuke\nTurn 7: Explode\n",
